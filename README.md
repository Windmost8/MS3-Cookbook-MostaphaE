* **Issues**  
    * At times, whilst previewing the site through port 8000 on gitpod and refreshing the page to update changed code, 
the refresh might not always go through, and therefore one must 
ctrl-click the refresh button for a forced refresh. 


---

## Deployment
---
* **Gitpod** 
    * To preview site through gitpod, run the command "python3 -m http.server" in the terminal (without the quotes). 
    * Executing this should prompt a pop up for port 8000
    alongside the options to "Make Public" or "Open Browser". If it is the first time after opening gitpod, then click on "Make Public", and then "Open Browser" if the pop up
    comes up again. If the pop up does not come, you may alternatively ctrl-click on the link that will be shown in the terminal for port 8000.
    * Gitpod has no automatic saving, so saving after each change is optimal.


* **Github** 
    * In order to commit, whilst still in gitpod, running the command git add . (or a specific file/folder instead of "." (without the quotes)),
    will add all the changes you have done to be prepared for a commit. 
    * After this step, you may run the command git commit -m "your comment" (your comment being whatever message you want to convey alongside the commit). Running this will 
    show how much changes were done, through the terminal.
    * Finally, running the command git push should put your changes and project into your repository.
